# Evolving Agents Labs

## About Our Research

We explore early-stage concepts in adaptive AI through experimental frameworks and research prototypes. Our work investigates how intelligent agents might adapt, learn, and evolve their behavior based on context, user interaction, and accumulated experience.

**All projects remain permanently in alpha status as ongoing research experiments.**

## ⚠️ Experimental Nature

**Important**: All our projects are research prototypes exploring early-stage concepts. They should be treated as experimental research material rather than production-ready systems. We believe in transparent, open research that advances the field through shared exploration.
