# Evolving Agents Labs

This is the official website for Evolving Agents Labs, showcasing our experimental frameworks and autonomous agent architectures.

## Projects

### LLMunix
A Pure Markdown Operating System designed to be run by Gemini CLI as its runtime engine. Everything is defined in markdown documents - Gemini CLI interprets the GEMINI.md manifest file to turn these specifications into a functional operating system. Requires the virtual tools feature from Gemini CLI Issue #1806 (available in the EvolvingAgentsLabs fork).

### Framework Core
Core architectural patterns and building blocks for autonomous agent systems with standardized interfaces and extensible components.

### Agent Examples
Real-world agent implementations showcasing practical applications of adaptive AI systems and autonomous task execution patterns.

## Development

This site is built with GitHub Pages and uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for optimal performance and simplicity.
