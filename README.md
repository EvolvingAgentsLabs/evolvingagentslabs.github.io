# Evolving Agents Labs

This is the official website for Evolving Agents Labs, showcasing our experimental frameworks and autonomous agent architectures.

## Projects

### Agent Forge
Revolutionary hybrid architecture combining OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b orchestrator with fine-tuned CodeLlama translator. Features just-in-time code compilation, dynamic tool generation, and benchmarkable performance improvements over pure LLM approaches. Includes comprehensive Google Colab guide for replication.

### LLMunix
A Pure Markdown Operating System designed to be run by Gemini CLI as its runtime engine. Everything is defined in markdown documents - Gemini CLI interprets the GEMINI.md manifest file to turn these specifications into a functional operating system. Requires the virtual tools feature from Gemini CLI Issue #1806 (available in the EvolvingAgentsLabs fork).

### JIT Agent Trilogy
- **jit-agent-poc**: Just-In-Time agent that dynamically compiles executable code from LLM-provided conceptual ideas
- **jit-agent-learn**: Extension focused on reinforcement learning capabilities and self-improvement
- **jit-agent-memory**: Adds persistent memory capabilities for contextual awareness and long-term retention
